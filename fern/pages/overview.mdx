title: API Overview
---

Complete the steps outlined in this page to create a demo Fern website for a fake Plant Store company. 

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a logo and favicon.">
Feel free to make a simple logo or use a placeholder.
</Step>
<Step title="Add a page to showcase the Plant Store API.">
This page should include at least 2 [Fern components](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/docs/content/components/overview), and should act as a landing page for the website.
</Step>
<Step title="Style the site.">
Make the site look professional and modern. You can use the styling configuration options provided in the [`docs.yml`](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/docs/getting-started/global-configuration) file, and/or add your own custom CSS.
</Step>
<Step title="Add custom JavaScript.">
In this scenario, the Plant Store company wants to use a custom JavaScript file to insert a floating action button into the bottom right corner of the entire site. When a user clicks the button, it should open [this website](https://buildwithfern.com) in the same tab. 
</Step>
<Step title="Remove this overview page.">
Once you've completed the steps outlined in this page, remove this page. The demo site should only include pages and content related to the Plant Store.
