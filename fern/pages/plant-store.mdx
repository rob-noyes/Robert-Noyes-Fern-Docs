## What you can do with the Plant Store API

The Plant Store API lets you manage your plant catalog programmatically. Common use cases include:

- Creating and updating plants in your inventory
- Tagging plants for search and categorization
- Tracking availability and lifecycle status
- Reacting to plant changes via webhooks

For full request and response details, see the API Reference.
